### [0.2.0] - 2016-05-27

The first release of the REPL browser allows one to browse annotated
objects in the Node REPL.

This includes the Browser object, which can inspect source code,
documentation, and a summary for the object. And a TerminalDisplay
object that tells the Browser how to display the information.

Displays are configurable, and need only to provide a `.show` method
that defines how to render the Browser AST.
