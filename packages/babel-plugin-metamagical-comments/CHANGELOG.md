## 0.x

### [0.12.0] - 2016-07-09


#### New features

  - [Allow users to configure Babylon's parsing of examples](https://github.com/origamitower/metamagical/commit/2ccf1f8b7bdd26d722625bef16599c63c5fd3362)

    Babel doesn't expose the configured Babylon version to plugins, so this
    is a compromise to allow different syntactical expectations to be used
    in examples


#### Fixes

  - [Don't compute module IDs if the packages don't have a name](https://github.com/origamitower/metamagical/commit/1fbab291b43c6affa9c51d2fc6cac7bb3d52bc85) ([#23](https://github.com/origamitower/metamagical/issues/23))

    If the `package.json` file doesn't have a `name`, we give up inferring the
    module ID. This way modules outside of packages always have to provide 
    their correct module IDs explicitly.

  - [Ensure ASI doesn't apply between examples.](https://github.com/origamitower/metamagical/commit/6cb2a46065e0c647821f6bb59e69bd28404679c3)

    Tracking these rules is hard for these cases, and failures are hard to
    understand. We still get things merged between example sections, but
    statements can't continue between one example section and the other.



### [0.11.1] - 2016-05-25

The first stable release of the plugin, features:

  - The ability to annotate function declarations, variable definitions, assignments, methods, getters and setters;
  - Inferring metadata from the definition (source, signature, name, parent object);
  - Including metadata from package.json and filename/source position;
  - Inferring examples from documentation text;

Known issues:

  - package.json's short URLs for repositories are not parsed yet;
  - CONTRIBUTORS/AUTHORS files are not parsed yet;
  - overrides are not tracked yet;
